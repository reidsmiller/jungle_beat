***************** Reid Miller's Jungle Beats ****************

Hello!

This 'jungle beats' program was created by Reid Miller.

In order to run the program, make sure you are in the jungle_beat directory and run the command `$ ruby jb_runner.rb`.

For a full list of available voices on your (Mac) computer go to System Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > System Voice.
These voices appear to be operating system dependent and the recommended voices I have listed may or may not work.

Enjoy!
